git status to see what has changed

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you get a .git file that basically allows for git commands to be used in that directory. git status will track which files changed or all files that are in that directory that aren't being tracked.


git add
- adds to the staging area

git commit
- commits the change and if you add -m you can add a message in ""
- also git commit . would commit all in the directory


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is where you add changes to be committed. The working directory is where you have initialized git (all your files) the repository operates on the working directory.
