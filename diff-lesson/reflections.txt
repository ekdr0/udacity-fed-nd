You can easily compare 2 files by using the command line diff command

EXAMPLE:
diff -u old.html new.html

on windows you use FC(which stands for file compare):
FC old.html new.html


This helps you easily spot bugs because it shows where new code was added (+ or - sign) and you can see where if your code worked in an old version where you changed code in the new version.

git commit

git diff

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro's
- you can be more deliberate about when and why to save
- you can be more specific about why to save


Con's
- You may forget to save for a while
- You might save and commit too often
- more difficult, higher learning curve.


git log --stat <- the --stat gives statistics about each commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
